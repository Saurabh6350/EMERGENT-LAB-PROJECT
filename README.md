# EMERGENT-LAB-PROJECT

## Project Overview

This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data analytics techniques to analyze textual data, extract meaningful insights, and build intelligent processing pipelines.
It demonstrates real-world applications of text preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning, and visualization within an end-to-end workflow.

---

## Objectives

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on raw text datasets
* Apply NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming and lemmatization
* Convert text into numerical features using methods like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings
* Train and evaluate machine learning models for prediction or classification
* Generate visual insights using plots and analytics dashboards

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy and Pandas for data handling
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
* Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
* NLTK or SpaCy for NLP preprocessing
* Jupyter Notebook or VS Code as the development environment

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Saurabh6350/EMERGENT-LAB-PROJECT.git
cd EMERGENT-LAB-PROJECT

### Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

### Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## How to Run

Open the notebooks folder and run the Jupyter notebooks
or execute Python scripts from the src directory:

python main.py

---

## Results and Evaluation

The project evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC or precision–recall curves.
Visualizations help interpret word frequency distributions, feature importance, and model comparison.

---

## Environment Variables

Sensitive keys and tokens are stored in the .env file, which is excluded from version control using .gitignore.

---

## Future Improvements

* Deep learning models such as LSTM, Transformers, and BERT
* Real-time text analytics dashboard
* Deployment using Streamlit or Flask
* Integration with external NLP APIs
